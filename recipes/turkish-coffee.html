    <h2>A Refreshing Turkish Coffee</h2>
    <p>Indulge in a timeless ritual with Turkish coffee, where finely ground beans swirl in a copper pot, embracing centuries of tradition. Sip on the rich, unfiltered essence of history, as each velvety-smooth sip transports you to the heart of Istanbul's bustling bazaars.</p>
    <p>Turkish coffee: a sensory journey that tantalizes taste buds and captures culture in every cup. Ground to a whisper, then simmered to perfection, it's not just a drink; it's a conversation starter, an art form, and a moment to savor the deep flavors of Turkey's past and present.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>
        Coffee Beans: Turkish coffee requires very finely ground coffee beans, almost a powder-like consistency. Arabica beans are commonly used for their rich flavor.
    </li>
    <li>Water: Fresh cold water is used to brew the coffee.</li>
    <li>Sugar: Optionally, you can add sugar to taste while brewing. It's common to have different levels of sweetness, from unsweetened to very sweet.</li>
    <li>Cardamom: Some variations of Turkish coffee include a pinch of ground cardamom, adding a unique and aromatic flavor.</li>
    <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix: In the ibrik, combine a heaping teaspoon of finely ground coffee per cup. Add sugar and cardamom if desired.</li>
        <li>Water: Pour cold water into the ibrik for each cup. Stir to mix everything.</li>
        <li>Heat: Place the ibrik on low heat. Let it foam up, then remove just before boiling. Repeat this once more.</li>
        <li>Pour: Gently pour the coffee into cups, foam included. Allow grounds to settle briefly.</li>
        <li>Savor: Sip slowly and enjoy the rich flavors of your Turkish coffee, along with the cultural experience it embodies.</li>
    </ol>
